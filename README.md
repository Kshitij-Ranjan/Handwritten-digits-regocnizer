Handwritten Digits Recognizer

My first Machine Learning project to predict handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

Overview

This project trains a simple ML model to recognize and classify handwritten digits (0â€“9).
It uses the MNIST dataset and demonstrates the basic workflow of building, training, and testing a model.

Features

Trains on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset

Evaluates the accuracy of the model

Predicts handwritten digits from test data

Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib

TensorFlow / Keras

scikit-learn

How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Kshitij-Ranjan/Handwritten-digits-recognizer.git
cd Handwritten-digits-recognizer


Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the script:

python main.py

Future Improvements

Add a simple GUI for user input

Support for real-time digit drawing

Experiment with different models for higher accuracy
